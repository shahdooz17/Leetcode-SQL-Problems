LeetCode 584: Find Customer Referee
======================================

Problem Description
----------------------

The **Customer** table contains information about customers and who referred them. We want to **find the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with `id = 2`.**

* * * * *

Table Schema
---------------

### `Customer`

| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | int | Unique ID of each customer   (Primary Key). |
| `name` | varchar | The customer's name. |
| `referee_id` | int | The `id` of the customer who referred them. Can be `NULL` if no referee. |

* * * * *

Example Input
----------------
###  `Customer`

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | NULL       |
| 2  | Jane | NULL       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | NULL       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |


* * * * *

Expected Output
-----------------
| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |


Explanation:

-   Alex (`referee_id = 2`) → excluded.

-   Mark (`referee_id = 2`) → excluded.

-   Others are included because their `referee_id` is either not `2` or `NULL`.

* * * * *

SQL Solution
---------------

```
SELECT name FROM Customer 
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

* * * * *

Query Explanation
--------------------

1.  `referee_id != 2` → ensures we exclude customers who were referred by `id = 2`.

2.  `referee_id IS NULL` → keeps customers who were not referred by anyone.

3.  Combining them with `OR` gives the final set of names.

* * * * *

**Key Insight**: We must use `IS NULL` instead of `= NULL` because in SQL, comparisons with `NULL` return `UNKNOWN`.
